# _CoffeeNow_

#### _An app for when you need coffee, right now._

#### By _**James Donlan**_

## Description

_Have you ever really needed coffee and not been entirely sure where you can get it? Sure it's not hard to find, but maybe you're visiting a new place or maybe you're just really tired right now and don't want to think about it. With CoffeeNow, all you need is your zip code! (GPS functionality coming soon)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Import project into Android Studio, preferably using the program itself_
* _Gradle will refuse to compile, go to the terminal and create gradle.properties and open it in Atom_
* _Insert your Yelp api key as YelpToken = "Bearer [key goes here]"_
* _Save and resync Gradle (may have to do this twice)_
* _Select "app" in the dropdown menu on the top right next to the green arrow, then click the arrow_
* _Set up an emulated Android phone to run it on. I recommend a Nexus 6 running Marshmallow or above, but anything above Ice Cream Sandwich should be all right. Or, hook up your own android device via USB and run it there if you like!_
* _Enjoy!_

## Proposed Future Functionality

* _Replace zip code search with user location from the phone's GPS, removing the need to type anything in._
* _Make prettier_

## Technologies Used

* _Java_
* _Android_
